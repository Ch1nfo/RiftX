# RiftX V2

RiftX V2 is a host-native durable agent execution platform. Its WebUI and CLI share a
single control plane, while long-running work is executed through resumable workflows
and node-local runners.

The implementation follows [`RIFTX_V2_DESIGN.md`](RIFTX_V2_DESIGN.md) and is developed
milestone by milestone:

1. Domain and persistence
2. Host runner
3. Tool and skill registries
4. Agent harness
5. Temporal integration
6. WebUI and CLI
7. Approval and PTY
8. Findings, artifacts, and reports
9. Remote runners and Windows support

## Development

Agent-related commands must run in the repository's `agent` Conda environment:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n agent python -m pytest
```

The package uses a `src/` layout and requires Python 3.12.
